 ## Advent of Code 2022

The most beautiful season of the year is back again...
What else fits this better than solving puzzles every day?
Check them out [here](https://adventofcode.com/)!

 #### My Apporach
 Last year, I tried this challenge using Python. But this time, I want to challenge myself by using my fresh knowledge in C++ :) I love this language, hoping to get better at it!

 #### Sidenotes
 I implemented some useful generic functions in nutils.cpp and nutils.h, have a look at it!
 ##### Some Goals for the Future:
 - automatic submission
 - better use of regex
 - complete the challenge!
